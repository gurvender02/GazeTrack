    <h2>Role and Infrastructure</h2>
    <img src="a7.jpg" alt="Government hospital facility">
    <p>Government hospitals serve as the backbone of public healthcare, offering multi-specialty clinical services, emergency care, and maternity wards at subsidized rates. They often partner with medical colleges, functioning as teaching hospitals and research centers.</p>
    <p>Infrastructure typically includes outpatient departments, inpatient wards, diagnostic labs, and operating theaters. Outreach programs extend services to rural areas through mobile clinics.</p>
    <h2>Challenges and Improvement Initiatives</h2>
    
    <p>Resource constraints such as limited funding, equipment shortages, and staffing gaps lead to high patient-to-doctor ratios. Administrative bottlenecks can delay care, and outdated record-keeping hampers efficiency.</p>
    <p>Digital health initiatives like electronic medical records (EMR) and telemedicine platforms improve patient tracking and remote diagnostics. Government schemes such as Ayushman Bharat provide coverage for millions, reducing out-of-pocket expenditure.</p>
    <h2>Community Engagement and Future Outlook</h2>
    <p>Community health workers and ASHA volunteers conduct health education and vaccination drives. Public-private partnerships bring specialized services and training programs into government hospitals.</p>
    <p>Investments in infrastructure modernization, AI-based diagnostics, and interoperable health information exchanges promise to elevate service quality and accessibility in the coming years.</p>
